## RTL Source Code

In this example, we drive a random number generator, with the source code as follows:


```verilog
module RandomGenerator (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input [15:0] seed,
    output [15:0] random_number
);
    reg [15:0] lfsr;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            lfsr <= seed;
        end else begin
            lfsr <= {lfsr[14:0], lfsr[15] ^ lfsr[14]};
        end
    end

    assign random_number = lfsr;
endmodule
```

This random number generator contains a 16-bit LFSR, with a 16-bit seed as input and a 16-bit random number as output. The LFSR is updated according to the following rules:

1. XOR the highest bit and the second-highest bit of the current LFSR to generate a `new_bit`.

2. Shift the original LFSR left by one bit, and place `new_bit` in the lowest bit.

3. Discard the highest bit.

## Testing Process
During testing, we will create a folder named `RandomGenerator`, which contains a `RandomGenerator.v` file. The content of this file is the RTL source code mentioned above.
### Building the RTL into a Python Module

#### Generating Intermediate Files
Navigate to the `RandomGenerator` folder and execute the following command:

```bash
picker export --autobuild=false RandomGenerator.v -w RandomGenerator.fst --sname RandomGenerator --tdir picker_out_rmg --lang python -e --sim verilator
```

This command does the following:

1. Uses `RandomGenerator.v` as the top file and `RandomGenerator` as the top module, generating a dynamic library with the Verilator simulator, targeting Python as the output language.

2. Enables waveform output, with the target waveform file being `RandomGenerator.fst`.

3. Includes files for driving the example project (`-e`), and does not automatically compile after code generation (`-autobuild=false`).

4. Outputs the final files to the `picker_out_rmg` directory.
The output directory structure is similar to [Adder Verification - Generating Intermediate Files](https://chatgpt.com/docs/quick-start/eg-adder/#generating-intermediate-files) , so it will not be elaborated here.
#### Building Intermediate Files
Navigate to the `picker_out_rmg` directory and execute the `make` command to generate the final files.
> Note: The compilation process is similar to [Adder Verification - Compilation Process](https://chatgpt.com/docs/quick-start/eg-adder/#building-intermediate-files) , so it will not be elaborated here.
The final directory structure will be:


```shell
picker_out_rmg
|-- RandomGenerator.fst # Waveform file from the test
|-- UT_RandomGenerator
|   |-- RandomGenerator.fst.hier
|   |-- _UT_RandomGenerator.so # Swig-generated wrapper dynamic library
|   |-- __init__.py  # Initialization file for the Python module, also the library definition file
|   |-- libDPIRandomGenerator.a # Library file generated by the simulator
|   |-- libUTRandomGenerator.so # libDPI dynamic library wrapper generated based on dut_base
|   `-- libUT_RandomGenerator.py # Python module generated by Swig
|   `-- xspcomm  # xspcomm base library, fixed folder, no need to pay attention to it
`-- example.py # Example code
```

### Configuring the Test Code

> Replace the content of `example.py` with the following code.

```python
from RandomGenerator import *
import random

# Define the reference model
class LFSR_16:
    def __init__(self, seed):
        self.state = seed & ((1 << 16) - 1)

    def Step(self):
        new_bit = (self.state >> 15) ^ (self.state >> 14) & 1
        self.state = ((self.state << 1) | new_bit ) & ((1 << 16) - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dut = DUTRandomGenerator()            # Create the DUT
    dut.InitClock("clk")                  # Specify the clock pin and initialize the clock
    seed = random.randint(0, 2**16 - 1)   # Generate a random seed
    dut.seed.value = seed                 # Set the DUT seed
    ref = LFSR_16(seed)                   # Create a reference model for comparison

    # Reset the DUT
    dut.reset.value = 1                   # Set reset signal to 1
    dut.Step()                            # Advance one clock cycle (DUTRandomGenerator is a sequential circuit, it requires advancing via Step)
    dut.reset.value = 0                   # Set reset signal to 0
    dut.Step()                            # Advance one clock cycle

    for i in range(65536):                # Loop 65536 times
        dut.Step()                        # Advance one clock cycle for the DUT, generating a random number
        ref.Step()                        # Advance one clock cycle for the reference model, generating a random number
        assert dut.random_number.value == ref.state, "Mismatch"  # Compare the random numbers generated by the DUT and the reference model
        print(f"Cycle {i}, DUT: {dut.random_number.value:x}, REF: {ref.state:x}") # Print the results
    # Complete the test
    print("Test Passed")
    dut.Finish()    # Finish function will complete the writing of waveform, coverage, and other files
```

### Running the Test Program
Execute `python example.py` in the `picker_out_rmg` directory to run the test program. After the execution, if `Test Passed` is output, the test is considered passed. After the run is complete, a waveform file `RandomGenerator.fst` will be generated, which can be viewed in the terminal using the following command:
> gtkwave RandomGenerator.fst
Example output:


```shell
