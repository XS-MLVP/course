**Toffee** is a hardware vafication framework written in Python that relies on the multilingual conversion tool [Picker](https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker). The tool is able to convert the Verilog code of the hardware design into a Python Package, allowing users to use Python to drive and verify the hardware design.

It absorbs part of the UVM verification methodology to ensure the standardization and reusability of the verification environment, and re-designs the construction of the whole verification environment to make it more in line with the use habits of developers in the software field, so that software developers can easily perform hardware verification work.

See detailed instructions for using Toffee in [Toffee Documentation](https://pytoffee.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/).
